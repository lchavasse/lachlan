AI Agents are a much overhyped and misunderstood concept. At one end of the spectrum we have an LLM that might be able to call a tool or two (something ChatGPT has done for years). At the other, we have autonomous actors functioning in the digital and even physical space.

Most simply:

> AI Agents are **programs where LLM outputs control the workflow**.

A few classifications of agents have been proposed. The following from Hugging Face keeps things simple. I’d argue there will be agents significantly beyond the 3 star class here very soon.

The working principle is simple, however. Create autonomous systems to deal with new scenarios. Usually these will be highly specialised, but the sky really is the limit.\
The vision is the ability to act with human level decision making over arbitrary input information, yet remain operating within certain (safety) limits.
