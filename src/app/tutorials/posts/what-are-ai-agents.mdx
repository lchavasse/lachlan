AI Agents is a very overhyped and misunderstood term. At one end of the spectrum we have an LLM that might be able to call a tool or two (something ChatGPT has done for years). At the other we have autonomous actors functioning in the digital and maybe even physical space.

Most simply:

A few classifications of agents have been proposed. The following from Hugging Face keeps things simple. I’d argue there will be agents significantly beyond the 3 star class here very soon.

The working principle is simple, however. Create autonomous systems to deal with new scenarios. Usually these will be highly specialised, but the sky really is the limit.

We’re going to start at [the beginning](https://www.lachlan.xyz/tutorials/why-langgraph), using a framework called [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph).
