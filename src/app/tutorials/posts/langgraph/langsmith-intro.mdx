description: What is LangSmith? Debugging made easy.

It is time we talked about the third piece of the Lang- Holy Trinity, [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/)

LangSmith takes the debugging process out of the command line and into an easy to use UI.

LangGraph events are logged automatically. Just signup for an API key and add the following to your .env file:

```python
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
LANGSMITH_API_KEY="lsv2_pt_XXXXXX"
LANGSMITH_PROJECT="langgraph-tutorial"
```

Thatâ€™s it! Just run the agent from the [previous tutorial](/tutorials/langgraph/rag-agent) and you can track the workflow.

Now lets use this whilst building a [multi-agent system](/tutorials/langgraph/multi-agent-system).
