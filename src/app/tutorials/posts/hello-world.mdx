# Welcome to My Blog

This is a test post to demonstrate the various features of my new blog system. It's built with Next.js, MDX, and styled to look similar to Notion.

## Code Examples

Here's a simple Python function:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Test the function
print(greet("World"))  # Output: Hello, World!
```

And some TypeScript:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

function greet(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}! You are ${user.age} years old.`;
}

const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25
};

console.log(greet(user));
```

## Text Formatting

You can write text in **bold**, *italic*, or ***both***. 

### Lists

Here are some list examples:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

- Unordered list
- With multiple items
- And more

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It can be used to highlight important information or quotes from other sources.
> 
> You can have multiple paragraphs in a blockquote.

## What's Next?

I'll be posting more content soon, including:
- Coding tutorials
- Tech insights
- Project updates
- And more!

Stay tuned!
