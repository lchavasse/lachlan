<br />

I launched [useDaily](https://usedaily.ai) on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/usedaily) a few weeks ago.

<br />

Here‚Äôs everything I did wrong‚Ä¶ üëá

1. Made my listing too late (*now that one‚Äôs obvious*)
2. Waited 9 months before a PH launch (*fair enough*)
3. Messaged everyone I knew to engage with the launch. (but *this surprised me!*)

Let me explain.

## The Setup: *What I Thought Would Work.*

I‚Äôve been quietly taking notes from all of my friends launches. Reading up on online wisdom. This was going to be the big push to get useDaily out into the world. A clear line in the sand where distribution was the only priority.

I thought I had everything figured.

<br />

I would message 1000 of my new-found LinkedIn connections. I would beg my friends and family to sign up to Product Hunt in advance. I would leverage the great communities I‚Äôm a part of in London.

I figured if I could bring 100 votes during the first 4 hours, I would get the visibility I was after.

I asked my current users to comment, suggesting some prompts to promote discussion.

<br />

I wasn‚Äôt going to pay a hunter to promote me - I find it bizarre that PH (indirectly*) encourage this. I wasn‚Äôt going to buy any upvotes.

<br />

And in some sense it worked. I brought in >100 upvotes. Half of which commented. I engaged with all of them.

<br />

But I was stuck in position #26 all day. My upvote points less than 50.

## The Problem: *What I missed!*

Product Hunt [make it clear](https://help.producthunt.com/en/articles/10275873-what-are-points) that there is not a 1:1 correspondence between upvotes and points.

I had a number of relatively new accounts upvoting me. Dedicated beta testers keen to support a product and vision they love. Communities helping each other out. I knew these would be weighted less. But I didn‚Äôt expect them to impact me negatively. And a 2:1 ratio of upvotes to points certainly hadn‚Äôt entered my head. 

<br />

I can only guess my network‚Äôs engagement was treated at spam.

How am I so sure? The comments they left were held from my inbox, coming through in dribs and drabs for days after the launch!

<br />

But my real problem? **I wasn‚Äôt featured.**

<br /> 

I still don‚Äôt quite understand what this means. But PH choose the listings that will get shown randomly on the front page during the first 4 hours.

I didn‚Äôt make the cut.

<br />

So I missed out on the random 50-100 upvotes you get from bots and automations in the first hour [ask anyone] I‚Äôm sure lots of these get cut out, but it left me starting on the back foot.

<br />

Maybe PH don‚Äôt like the sound of useDaily. But I think my disorganisation could be to blame.

I locked in the launch a week before. Probably okay.

But I didn‚Äôt make changes to my website, graphics etc until last minute. So the listing could have appeared a touch amateur.

<br />

**That‚Äôs Big mistake #1.**

#2 was more subtle.

## Bringing My Network

Until August 2025, PH had a ‚Äúnotify me‚Äù button on your pre-launch page. Whilst slightly unreliable - no notification if you didn‚Äôt get featured for example - it was a place you could direct your pre-launch traffic. In replacement, I created a Google Form to collect details for a launch email - this would include PH, LinkedIn and Twitter.

<br />

I must‚Äôve sent 1000 messages, touted a QR code around several events to get 60 odd people (plus a hit list of people who failed to fill in the form)

I was feeling confident.

<br />

8am Launch Day, I sent out an email with three links: PH, LinkedIn, X - plus a few prompts for some targeted questions.

Then I started messaging all the rest.

And people came through.

<br />

The issue, the algorithm didn‚Äôt like it one bit.

PH throttled my points.

LinkedIn gave me very little organic reach. Turns out I‚Äôd forced the very people who would have come across my post naturally to link to it.

<br />

It was my second best performing post on LinkedIn, but for >100 comments, it should have gone a lot further.

## The Results.

I must confess I was a touch disappointed by my launch. Yes I brought in a fair number of new users and got people talking about my product. But most of that came from re-engaging with my existing network.

<br />

But what should I have done?

## The Lesson: What I‚Äôll do Next Time.

I would still inform my network in advance. Even notify them on the day. But no links. It‚Äôs a bigger ask, and might have to be reserved for a smaller inner circle, but the reach to let them find it organically would have been worlds apart.

<br />

Crucially I would have had a core group of regular PH users in my network, maybe 20 or so. Ones that would be a great boost to the algorithm there. Dependable friends who I could rely on to boost my listing in the first 4 hours.

<br />

**But above all, you need to be featured.**

How should I have achieved this?

<br />

List earlier, sure!

But probably launch before. Not for any great results, but to get established in the system.

<br />

So if you‚Äôre reading this considering a Product Hunt launch in the future. Launch Today. Share it round some close friends. Not for any result other than setting things up for your big launch.

*Or just make a viral launch video and skip PH ;)*

*They say:

**Paying hunters or promoters**
There is no rule against using a hunter outside of your team, but paying people to hunt your product goes against our guidelines.

*But the results beg to differ!!!*
