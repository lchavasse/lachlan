# A Rundown of the best Text-to-Speech (TTS) Models

There's an awful lot of TTS voices to choose from now, but only a few are really good. The kind of good where you forget you're talking to a computer. I'm sharing my favourites here.

**My hot take**
All the best voices I can find are invariably Australian, and usually male. Second place is usually female American accents. British accents seem a lot less reliable.

ElevenLabs and Cartesia lead the way with these.

I've even noticed this Aussie twang creep in when cloning my own voice. Perhaps the Australians replaced themselves with AI years ago and went to the beach..?
