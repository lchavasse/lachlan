There's an awful lot of TTS voices to choose from now, but only a few are really good. The kind of good where you forget you're talking to a computer. I'm sharing my favourites here.
<br />
**My hot take**
All the best voices I can find are invariably Australian, and usually male. Second place is usually female American accents. British accents seem a lot less reliable.

ElevenLabs and Cartesia lead the way with these.
<br />
I've even noticed this Aussie twang creep in when cloning my own voice. Perhaps the Australians replaced themselves with AI years ago and went to the beach..?

### Me as a quasi Aussie:

## The Rundown

1. [**ElevenLabs**](https://elevenlabs.io/)

**Pros:** Wide range of apealing voices. Also some great voice cloning, and prompt generated voices.

**Cons:** Fairly expensive: ~$0.13/min unless you have an enterprise plan

<br />

**Voices:**

**Sarah** - EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL

*sounds like Carrie from Four Weddings, but feels a touch jolty and artificial*

**Bill Oxley** - T5cu6IU92Krx4mh43osx

*bit jarring, but quite smooth*

**Steve - Australian Male** - aGkVQvWUZi16EH8aZJvT

*Aussie and Awesome!!!*

**My Aussie Voice** - ZilQMipjuRmZuop2IIo4
*Generated from 20s of low quality audio*

**Custom Prompt** - I7DvLw2gB0QeYpFAE9ta

"""
A soft british male voice, with soothing dulcet tones, good manners and an air of sophistication.
NO BACKGROUND NOISE
"""

<br />

2. [**Cartesia**](https://cartesia.ai/)

**Pros:** Mixing voices, including clones, is the best feature. And the price ~$0.03/min !!!

**Cons:** Fewer high quality options compared with ElevenLabs

<br />

*Their best voice is also called Sarah - feels very smooth and animated.*

**Sarah** - 694f9389-aac1-45b6-b726-9d9369183238

<br />

3. [**OpenAI**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech)

Alloy is already a recognisable female AI voice. It tends to be a bit jumpy out the box in realtime audio applications, however.

Really cheap though (~$0.01/min)!!!

4. [**Google** TTS](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech)

A stalwart of the TTS. There are some good voices, most notably "en-AU-Journey-D", but nothing remarkable.

5. [**Play.ai**](https://play.ai/)

Okay, DeeDee is a good voice.

6. [**Rime**](https://www.rime.ai/)

Voices seem too fast, but if you slow it down it sounds very unnatural.


7. [**Deepgram**](https://www.deepgram.com/text-to-speech)

A solid STT but not delivering on the TTS side just yet.
