**I had a poor first impression of SF.**
<br />
I arrived, exhausted from an all-nighter – pleasure not business I must confess - to find myself in some random peoples’ house (I was dog sitting) still struggling to push my business forwards.
<br />
I ventured out to a tech event that felt rather like one in London, a few interesting talks and people, but the usual transactional awkwardness. *And a distinct lack of alcohol.*
<br />
I took public transport, in of itself very effective, but very evidently something which those who can afford to avoid, do.

It is this disparity that makes SF feel so unsettling for me. Adverts from the latest infra company pasted on a crumbly bus shelter surrounded by rejects from a segregated society, whilst the audience for that ad drive past in Teslas and Waymos.
<br />
I grew to like certain aspects of the city. The quiet markets of Glen Park, the charming painted wooden buildings, the nature and parks. Even the coffee started to feel cheap when it pinged on my phone in pounds. Yet I never really felt welcome.

There is nothing deeply wrong with SF. But I was underwhelmed.
<br />
I think it had been overhyped for me. Yes, the attitude is more optimistic. There is more time to follow wild dreams for the future. Money is more risky. Yet fundamentally, the money still chases firm reliable bets. Traction and history are everything. A few exceptions slip through the cracks, but that is all.
<br />
For sure I met a few cool people. Learned about some ambitious projects. Although a lot of them had come from abroad. The city was quiet, not awash with the optimistic energy I had expected. I did go to one 600 person meetup hosted by WorkOS, with some excellent food and an open bar. I missed the talks (too many bugs to fix) but I wonder if I was the only one.
<br />
That might have been my problem. I was pushing for some ambitious goals with daily, battling API approval procedures that could only be conceived as a Promethean punishment.
<br />
Yet I went for customer research, to understand the culture and mindset and, perhaps, find some early users for daily. I wasn’t very successful. Perhaps I failed to adjust my pitch from a London audience; I thought it had landed well in New York.
<br />
I met a founder who had come down from Pennsylvania to try to change his mindset. Making millions in revenue, mind. But he thought he could find something in the water here that would unlock 10x growth. I should find out if her succeeded.
<br />
I sometimes wonder if moving to San Francisco is simply the best excuse we can come up with to go all in. Abandon our other follies. Change our mindset. Lock in. It’s a shame if we can’t do that in London. But I suppose sacrifice feels harder when everything you love is on your doorstep. I wonder if that’s why I would find it so hard to leave.

I think in another chapter of my life, I could grow to love San Francisco. The relaxed energy. The quirky mix of tech and hippies. The wild ocean, and temperamental weather.

I’m sure I could make friends there.
<br />
But at the end of the day there are only three types of people in sf.
1.	Tech Bros
2.	Hippies
3.	Addicts

Anyone else used to be one of them and has since been forgotten by society and left to catch the bus.

*Is that where I want my legacy to be?*
