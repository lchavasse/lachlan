At a recent tech panel, someone asked: “What is your favourite product and why?”

It’s one of those classic interview questions for product managers and designers. The way someone answers tells you how they think about products, design, and UX.

*For companies who consider themselves product-first, it’s a revealing test.*

## Why interviewers ask: "What is your favourite product?”

When someone answers “what is your favourite product?” you learn:

- how they evaluate usability,
- whether they notice delightful design details,
- and if they can articulate improvements.

It’s a small question that reveals big things about a person’s product thinking.

## My struggle with choosing a favourite product

For a while I was stymied. 

Almost every product I use frustrates me in some way. Yet I trudge on. The need the serve often being too great to switch.

The Google Suite is up there.

Ads in Gmail are annoying (but forgivable for a free product). But I certainly have no complaints about Google Meet.

Yet Google feels like a boring answer.

<br />

And as a former Product Manager, surely I should have something more inspired.

For a while, I thought my answer might be Cursor, which has genuinely helped my coding workflows. Yet at the end of the day, it’s a VS Code wrapper. Helpful, yes. But favourite? Not quite.

## The product that finally clicked: Wispr Flow

Months later, I've found my real answer.

A product I never see until I hold “fn.”

A product that saves me time every single day.

It finally clicked when I was dictating natural langauge for a SQL query into the Supabase AI. Too lazy to write it, I spoke it — and Wispr Flow immediately converted it to the query I needed.
A feature I had no idea existed subtly inserted itself into my workflow.

I was genuinely shocked.
It felt like magic.

## The final problem.

Yet I had two final frustrations with Wispr Flow.

The first I solved whilst writing this. Surely you can get rid of the annoying pill icon floating on my screen, I thought...

Perhaps they could use a better onboarding, but I suppose I'm past that now.

<br />

Yet the unsolvable problem. I didn’t write this post using Wispr as I’m in a coworking space.

I think this is the biggest obstacle for voice. *Social Awkwardness.*

<br />

When I have an office, I will have to normalise speaking to computers. The productivity gains are simply too great.

## Why this would be my interview answer

If asked “what is your favourite product?” in an interview, this is now my honest answer: Wispr Flow.

Not because it’s perfect, but because it reflects what I value in products:
- genuine productivity gains,
- thoughtful user experience,
- and a glimpse into the future of how we’ll work.

To me the question is this:

***"What do you use daily that the experience is just so delightful you wouldn’t use anything else?"***
